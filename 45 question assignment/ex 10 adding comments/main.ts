// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs 
//you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
// If you don’t have anything specific to write because
// your programs are too simple at this point, just 
//add your name and the current date at the top of each 
//program file. Then write one sentence describing what
// the program does.

// here we take a favourite number 
let favNumber = 1;
// and also take a message variable and print them
let message ="My favourite Number is:";
console.log(message , favNumber);
// and message print with favnumber like my favourite number is :1
// thats called adding comment in program
